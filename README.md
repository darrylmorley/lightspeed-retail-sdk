# Another Unofficial Lightspeed Retail V3 API SDK

A JavaScript SDK for interacting with the Lightspeed Retail API. This SDK provides a convenient way to access Lightspeed Retail's functionalities, including customer, item, order management, and more.

## Update

This package has been enhanced to support both CommonJS and module usage. I have also added methods for fetching both a gift card, and all gift cards.

## Features

- Easy-to-use methods for interacting with various Lightspeed Retail endpoints.
- Built-in handling of API rate limits.
- Automatic token management for authentication.
- Support for paginated responses from the Lightspeed API.
- Retry logic for handling transient network issues.

## Installation

```bash
npm install lightspeed-retail-sdk
```

## Get started:

```
import LightspeedRetailSDK from "lightspeed-retail-sdk";

const api = new LightspeedRetailSDK({
  accountID: "Your Account No.",
  clientID: "Your client ID.",
  clientSecret: "Your client secret.",
  refreshToken: "Your refresh token.",
});

export default api
```

## Example Request

```
const item = await api.getItem(7947, '["Category", "Images"]');
console.log(item);

7497 being the itemID. You can pass required relations as above.
```
